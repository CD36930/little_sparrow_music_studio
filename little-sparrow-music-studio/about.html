<P CLASS="about_text">
    Little Sparrow Music Studio in Chester, Virginia seeks to foster music in everyone! It is our hope that lessons and rehearsals convey a joy in both learning & making music and that this joy is shared with others. The studio welcomes all ages, from preschool music classes, to choirs, to school age individual lessons, to adults seeking to further or begin their music study.
    Lessons
    In addition to the traditional individual piano and voice lessons, group lessons are also offered, providing a broad support system, cost beneficial lessons and camaraderie for the new piano student.
    Choirs
    Our choirs develop the unique instrument inherent in everyone: the voice. Rehearsals build musical skills such as tone production, intonation, rhythm, note reading and singing in harmony as well as confidence builders and friendships.
    Founder and Instructor
